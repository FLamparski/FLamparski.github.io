I'm Filip Wieland, and I make software.

I've worked with several programming languages, most recently JavaScript (both client and server-side). I've done some Android Java and am also learning C. I also do some web design on the side (see this site for example).

I'm currently working for [chaser.io](https://www.chaser.io), a company that provides SaaS solutions for automated credit control/debtor reminders (invoice chasing).

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
