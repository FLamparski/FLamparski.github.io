This is probably not going to be very interesting, as I'm just setting up the Jekyll site.

## What's this about?

I'm starting a blog documenting my experiences with programming, the internet, and a range of other things.
I will also use this space to tell you more about the development of Ipsum and other projects.

I'll probably be integrating Disqus as my comment system soon enough.
