I do not believe I am wrong in saying that the majority of university applicants go
through [UCAS][wiki:ucas]{: target="_blank"} as part of their
sixth form experience. In fact, I did the same thing back with
[Christ the King: Aquinas][aquinas-hp]{: target="_blank"}.

## References and statements

I found writing my personal statement to be relatively straightforward compared
to obtaining a reference from one of my previous teachers. Your general options
for getting people to look at your statement are to either bother your friends
or try and crowdsource it by involving, say, the entire
[London Enlightened][enlondon]{: target="_blank"}
community (Enlightened of the [Ingress][wiki:ingress]{: target="_blank"} variety).

One thing to note when writing your personal statement is that the 4000 character
limit is not _exactly_ the source of truth - it has to be something along the
lines of 4000 characters across 47 lines under their line-breaking algorithm,
oh and if you use a new-line character it will count as two because of the
`\r\n` convention.

So while the UCAS Apply, uh, application is a whole failboat's worth of WTF in and of
itself (more on that in a future blog post), I think one of the most difficult
parts of the process is getting a reference. Unlike a regular character or personal
reference, this one should underline the applicant's learning ability and passion
for the subject they chose. It is not trying to convince an HR person to
hire somebody, but rather an admissions tutor to offer somebody a place at
university. Therefore, I believe that good quality references of such type are more
likely to come from one's teachers rather than an employer or colleague.
Obtaining such a reference whilst _at_ college is hard.

Getting one when you've already _left_ the college is much, much harder.

## Pick your referee.

This should be someone who remembers you a lot, and that you trust to
write a solid, high-quality reference. Unfortunately, those teachers are usually
swamped by other students' requests for references and help with personal
statements, which they have to prioritise.

## Prepare to email them. A lot.

One of the oft-repeated phrase at [Chaser][chaser] is "polite persistence pays".
While I can't easily use this product for my current need (I'm chasing a reference,
not an overdue invoice), the principle itself is solid.

I am now sending up to 4 emails per week, to multiple members of staff in the
college. Some of them are general purpose reception emails which means I get to
perform miniature 'amplification attacks'. As of me writing this, it is still
not enough.

## Have backups.

I sincerely hope I've managed to get enough people to remember me in case I need
to ask someone else for a reference at the last minute. I hope to send off
my application by the end of November. If I can't get the reference from my
primary person of choice by then, I'll have to ask someone else.

Half of the month has already gone past. Tick tock.
