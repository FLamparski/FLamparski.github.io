<blockquote>
The Tories Have Won, and All the Media and Corporate Barons and the Victim
Blaming Show Producers Have Won, If We Allow Our Politics to Be Shaped by
Neo-Liberalism, Whether from Lack of Ideas or from Delusional Respect.
You Should Never Try to Freeze Politics. What You Can Do Is Recycle That
Politics. Take Your Party’s Hand-Me-Down Old Policies and Re-Style Them,
Re-Fashion Them to the Point Where They Become Your Own. But Don’t Just
Regurgitate Political History, or Hold Ideas and Policies and Arguments as
Fixed, Untouchable and Kept Under Glass. The People Who Try to ‘Guard’ Any
Particular Form of Politics Are, Like the Media and Manufactured Pressure
Groups, Doing It the Worst Disservice, Because the Only Thing That You Can Do
to Politics That Will Damage It Is Not Change It, Not Make It Your Own.
Because Then It Dies, Then It’s Over, Then It’s Done, and
<strong>the Tories Have Won.</strong>

Ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that neo-liberalism of the Conservative
Party is healthy. In fact, I do not believe it has a place in this
Internet-driven world. Not only do they represent the Old Guard of business,
polluting the environment and doing a bang-up job of managing the finance
sector, but their austerity programme seems to lead up up to reducing the size
of the government until it disappears in a singularity or becomes a dense
contract enforcement platform. That is not spectacularly good, because
government spending is very much needed for the IT (or indeed any) industry
to flourish.

Think about it this way: If they cut education funding, primary schools and
nurseries may not be able to afford new observation solutions, which ultimately
will save them time and money in the long run. Because of this, the startups
behind them might not be able to attract more investment or customers, and their
founders, employees and other assorted types of workforce does not get to spend
their money in the economy at large. I invite you to read
[Benjamin Studebaker's blog](http://benjaminstudebaker.com/2015/05/02/britain-for-the-love-of-god-please-stop-david-cameron/) for a fuller explanation.

The same will hold true for any further cuts to public spending the government
makes. Every pound cut helps keep economy from growing. It's almost like that's
their real plan, eh?

Labour is not much better either. Their idea is 'Austerity Lite', which is still
government cuts (just a bit less of them). Their mansion tax idea is a step in
the right direction in terms of raising money for the government and reducing
tax burden on lower income earners, however it is utterly inadequate in the
face of the damage done by David Cameron's clique.

Both parties are oddly quiet in terms of Internet surveillance and rampant
'anti-piracy' laws encroaching on the freedom of speech. They also don't
mention other issues important to the digital world like TTIP and the near
monopoly US businesses have over the cloud.

Next time, please give the Greens a go. I doubt they'd achieve much of their
hard-left manifesto in just five years, but at least they can stop the bleeding.
