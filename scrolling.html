                    <p>After sending a plane to collect wind samples arriving from China, the only thing that Rodó could identify was fungal spores belonging to a group called Candida. Fungal spores are light enough to travel large distances. For instance, microbes have been known to go as high up as the upper stratosphere, as they get lifted by strong winds or volcanoes. Candida spores can also trigger immune reactions. But there isn't enough data to confirm the cause is Candida yet.</p>
