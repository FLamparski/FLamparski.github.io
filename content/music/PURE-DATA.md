## Lyrics

T minus ten, it's over soon\
Can do nothing but watch the world be consumed\
You can pretend that the choice was yours\
But your mind has never been a more attractive resource\
The wire's hot, your sweat is cold\
Machines can only do exactly what they're told\
You'll be immortal, but you'll never grow old\
Your mind can be set free as your body hits the floor

And here you are among the stars\
Pure data, sights and sounds\
And you'll never fall in love again\
Pure data, no pleasure and no pain

Twenty years later you're coming home\
Can do nothing but watch your loved ones moving on\
You can pretend that the choice was yours\
Oh the crossroad after midnight has a powerful force\
You're just a ghost, a cog in this machine\
Taking you further than you could ever dream\
You are immortal, but you paid the price\
You no longer get to live but you won't ever die

And here you are among the stars\
Pure data, sights and sounds\
And you'll never fall in love again\
Pure data, no pleasure and no pain

And here you are among the stars\
Pure data, sights and sounds\
And you'll never fall in love again\
Pure data, no pleasure and no pain

## Trivia

This started out as a shitpost about how anxiety diagnostics are useless when everyone has
anxiety and that anxiety is to some degree warranted. One line still made it to the final song.
