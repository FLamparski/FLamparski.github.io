## Lyrics

I feel like I'm floating\
And the world just goes by\
I tried many ways of coping\
But nothing really works for my\
Mind\
I wanna feel something\
Some connection to the world,\
But I feel like I'm on a spaceship\
That lost its course

Cause it's hard to drag myself\
Out of the abyss and into hell\
And every time I see\
the pretty lights\
They remind me of the darkness\
That I carry inside\
I'll do it every time\
I won't pretend that I was fine\
We all have our own bad place\
And I'll conquer mine

I can feel the world turning\
But sometimes, I don't turn too\
I see a thousand fires burning\
"Oh but it doesn't affect you"\
I'm tired of explaining\
That my brain doesn't work like that\
'cause there are no sweet dreams here\
And everything is fucked

And it's hard to drag myself\
Out of the abyss and into hell\
And every day I see\
the pretty lights\
They remind me of the darkness\
That I carry inside\
I'll do it every time\
I won't pretend that I was fine\
We all have our own bad place\
And I'll conquer mine

(Conquer mine)\
(Conquer mine)\
(Conquer mine)\
(Conquer mine)\
(Conquer mine)\
(Conquer mine)

And it's hard to drag myself\
Out of the abyss and into hell\
And every day I see\
the pretty lights\
They remind me of the darkness\
That I carry inside\
I'll do it every time\
I won't pretend that I was fine\
We all have our own bad place\
And I'll conquer mine

## Trivia

This is the first song I released on The Platforms where I used my DIY Eurorack modules - two
[Misguided SSI2131 VCOs][vco] going into an early version of the [Misguided Mx JFET filter][vcf].
This was used for one layer of the bassline, lead melodies, and filter sweep effects.

A lot of the other sounds came from my Microfreak, including some drums, another layer of the
bassline, and the organ heard in the choruses and the bridge section. The drum samples are often
a combination of several Microfreak patches, recordings I made myself, and a couple of TR-909 kick
samples.

The phone line samples were recorded while I was self-isolating - I figured I might as well get
some mileage out of the structures the government put in place. They're recording the calls on their
end anyway.
