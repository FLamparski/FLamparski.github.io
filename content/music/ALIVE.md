I didn't set out to write another love song, but then I came up with the cheesiest DX7-style
riff imaginable.

## Lyrics

I wanna go where the days are colder\
I wanna take a train to nowhere\
I wanna know that I'll be holding\
Your hand tonight\
Let's see the world before it burns down\
Let's dance until we fall to the ground\
I wanna be in the here and now\
Looking into your eyes

So why keep listening\
to that voice in your head\
yeah, that voice in your head\
That's telling horror stories\
So why don't you\
Let me know instead\
Yeah, let me know instead\
Are you coming with me

Let's meet when the summer's all done\
We don't, we don't have to go home\
It's just us in the morning light\
We don't, we don't have to get things right\
'Cause when you hold me I feel alive\
It's all, it's all we need tonight\
So let's meet when the summer's all done\
And I don't have to let you go (We don't, we don't have to let go)


And all the thoughts running through my head\
Can't shake the feeling, I'll build it up instead\
You make me feel at home anywhere\
Give that a chance\
I wanna play some video games\
We can escape the world in flames\
And when we're done I want you to stay\
Here in my arms

So will you trust me\
And listen to your heart\
Yeah, listen to your heart\
And throw away the worries\
So why don't we\
Wish upon a star,\
Yeah wish upon a star\
Will you be mine?

Let's meet when the summer's all done\
We don't, we don't have to go home\
It's just us in the morning light\
We don't, we don't have to get things right\
'Cause when you hold me I feel alive\
It's all, it's all we need tonight\
So let's meet when the summer's all done\
And I don't have to let you go (We don't, we don't have to let go)
