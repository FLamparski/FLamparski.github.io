## Lyrics

Hello, and welcome to the end of the world\
I'll be your guide\
First let's make sure you know the score\
And where to hide\
Couple of safety notes\
To keep in mind\
There's no shortage of useless quotes\
For you and I

Is there hope or am I kidding myself\
In this world it seems that nobody cares\
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say\
That tearing it all down is the only way

If you look to the right, you'll see them in lines\
Waiting at the morals bank\
Their balance isn't very strong and stable\
Like the boats they want to send bank to France\
And if you look to the left you won't see much at all\
They sold their souls to the Daily Mail\
And were left out in the cold

Is there hope or am I kidding myself\
In this world it seems that nobody cares\
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say\
That tearing it all down is the only way

And while it all burns down\
Like where it all began\
Say we don't give a damn\
Say we don't give a damn

Is there hope or am I kidding myself\
In this world it seems that nobody cares\
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say\
That tearing it all down is the only way
