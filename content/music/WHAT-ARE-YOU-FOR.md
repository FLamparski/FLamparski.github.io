Deathtrap started out as a slightly ill-fitting solo for What Are You For, and I already had
the project set up for a more rock-y sound. What Are You For started out as two lyrical ideas
I had when I couldn't sleep and ended up expressing my everlasting rage at the ruling class,
and specifically one prime minister who liked to party while people died by the thousands.

What Are You For features [Georgia](https://twitter.com/mindtheflap/) on the vocals.

## Lyrics - What Are You For

Burn everything down\
Turn it all to ash\
So you can wear the crown\
Of this island of trash\
Bodies piling high\
No-one's left alive\
You're selling out our future\
Just to give your mates some cash

Parties, wine, lockdown's fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown's fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown's fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown fine\
Parties parties parties parties\
Parties parties parties fine

Wide awake, alone with my thoughts\
Everything I saw, everything I lost\
Here you are, always by my side\
But it's all a lie, yeah it's all a lie\
No more, we all know the score\
Pack your case of shame and close the door\
Grinning wide, miles away from war\
What are you for, what are you for?

Castles made of sand\
Falling one by one\
Vultures circling over your head\
Wherever you stand\
Power makes you high\
So easy to lie\
You may have your loyal minions\
But do you have a friend?

Parties, wine, lockdown's fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown's fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown's fine\
Parties, wine, lockdown fine\
Parties parties parties parties\
Parties parties parties fine

Wide awake, alone with my thoughts\
Everything I saw, everything I lost\
Here you are, always by my side\
But it's all a lie, yeah it's all a lie\
No more, we all know the score\
Pack your case of shame and close the door\
Grinning wide, miles away from war\
What are you for, what are you for?

There's only one thing I want to know\
There's only one thing you need to show\
And we're all waiting for you to go\
What are you for, what are you for?

What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for?\
What are you for? (Parties, wine, lockdown's fine)\
What are you for? (Parties, wine, lockdown fine)\
What are you for? (Parties, wine, lockdown's fine)\
What are you for? (Parties, wine, lockdown fine)\
What are you for? (Parties, wine, lockdown's fine)\
What are you for? (Parties, wine, lockdown fine)\
What are you for? (Parties parties parties parties)\
What are you for? (Parties parties parties fine)

Wide awake, alone with my thoughts\
Everything I saw, everything I lost\
Here you are, always by my side\
But it's all a lie, yeah it's all a lie\
No more, we all know the score\
Pack your case of shame and close the door\
Grinning wide, miles away from war\
What are you for, what are you for?

## Lyrics - Deathtrap

And your brain is a death trap on most days\
And my brain is a death trap, we're both the same\
Each day an adventure, but that's okay\
'Cause even from death traps, we can escape\
We'll find a way

Yeah you were down, you're stronger now\
And you can find your way out\
The death trap sprang, you're still around\
And now you start to see the light\
Yeah you were down, you're stronger now\
And you can find your way out\
The death trap sprang, you're still around\
You're here, and that's what really counts

And my brain is a death trap on most days\
And your brain is a death trap, we're both the same\
Each day an adventure, but that's okay\
'Cause even from death traps, we can escape\
We'll find a way

Yeah you were down, you're stronger now\
And you can find your way out\
The death trap sprang, you're still around\
And now you start to see the light\
Yeah you were down, you're stronger now\
And you can find your way out\
The death trap sprang, you're still around\
You're here, and that's what really counts

_Insert sick solo here_

Yeah you were down, you're stronger now\
And you can find your way out\
The death trap sprang, you're still around\
And now you start to see the light\
Yeah you were down, you're stronger now\
And you can find your way out\
The death trap sprang, you're still around\
You're here, and that's what really counts
