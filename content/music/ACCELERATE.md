## Lyrics

Run, run away into the matrix\
Cynical and bored, we don't care for our safety\
Hide, hide away behind your computer\
Leave a world of lies fading into the future\
On the radio waves, we all saw it\
Fukuyama's ghost leaving aliens in storage\
Wear your meta mask, join the circus\
May the apes and lions right click and save us

(Vite! Fast! Schnell! Szybko!)

Accelerate away!\
It's a game, it's the fame, just you wait\
It's time to run away!\
It's a game, it's the same, I can't wait\
It's the progress we make,\
it's for wars that we wage,\
To get the numbers up\
So accelerate away!\
These electric dreams will not fade\
Accelerate away!

Run, run away into the matrix\
It's the new frontier and we just can't escape it\
Hide, hide away behind your computer\
Artificial souls built for every user\
Can't you see the lights, they are calling\
We are going bust just to see the next morning\
We've been on the brink forever\
Liminal spaces getting busier than ever

(Vite! Fast! Schnell! Szybko!)

Accelerate away!\
It's a game, it's the fame, just you wait\
It's time to run away!\
It's a game, it's the same, I can't wait\
It's the progress we make,\
it's for wars that we wage,\
To get the numbers up\
So accelerate away!\
These electric dreams will not fade\
Accelerate away!

It's the chances we take,\
It's the memories we make,\
you can't tell\
What is real and what's fake\
It's the thirst we can't slake\
It's the choices we make,\
Turn it up, turn it up

Accelerate away!\
It's a game, it's the fame, just you wait\
It's time to run away!\
It's a game, it's the same, I can't wait\
It's the progress we make,\
it's for wars that we wage,\
To get the numbers up\
So accelerate away!\
These electric dreams will not fade\
Accelerate away!

## Trivia

There's an unreleased song between this and Pure Data. Maybe I'll release it one day. It is also
extra cheesy.
