## Lyrics

I know a girl who hates summer\
It just isn't her style\
Struggling to stay hydrated\
On the Northern Line\
Yeah, I know a girl who hates summer\
The moment it comes\
She would load up her phone with her favourite songs\
And off colder climes she goes

'Cause when you step outside in the summer\
It feels like a nuclear fireball\
It's too hot to think in the summer\
Putting us into thermal overload\
But take my hand and we will survive\
Everything *is* going to be fine\
I know you really don't like summer\
But I don't mind

I know a girl who hates summer\
As if the sun itself was hard\
Rush hour at the station\
Close your eyes and ignore the crowd\
Yeah, I know a girl who hates summer\
When the calendar hits July\
I will write a song to make you smile\
And forget about the hellish sky

'Cause when you step outside in the summer\
It feels like a nuclear fireball\
It's too hot to think in the summer\
Putting us into thermal overload\
But take my hand and we will survive\
Everything *is* going to be fine\
I know you really don't like summer\
But I don't mind
