## Anxious Positivity - Lyrics

There's this anxious positivity in the air\
You still want to hide from the world\
But maybe slightly less so\
You can see some possibilities coming near\
But tempering your expectations\
You can still come crashing down, so

Maybe you want to take it slow\
Before you step outside you could come by the window\
Maybe you feel it's all out of control\
Keep it in mind that the news is a freak show\
Maybe think you cannot cope\
But look at all these years, you've been going on strong\
And even if you think you're truly over and done\
Put your mind to it and you can take the world on

The future is a terrifying and uncertain place\
Eagerness seems like a masquerade\
And there's comfort in the darkness\
There's no telling what life might throw you in the face\
You can shut yourself inside forever\
But that's never been the answer, so

Maybe you want to take it slow\
Before you step outside you could come by the window\
Maybe you feel it's all out of control\
Keep it in mind that the news is a freak show\
Maybe think you cannot cope\
But look at all these years, you've been going on strong\
And even if you think you're truly over and done\
Put your mind to it and you can take the world on

Take your time, do it all on your own terms\
Take your time, do it all on your own terms\
Take your time, do it all on your own terms\
Take your time, do it all on your own terms

Maybe you want to take it slow\
Before you step outside you could come by the window\
Maybe you feel it's all out of control\
Keep it in mind that the news is a freak show\
Maybe think you cannot cope\
But look at all these years, you've been going on strong\
And even if you think you're truly over and done\
Put your mind to it and you can take the world on

## Dissociate - Lyrics

It's "Why?" and "Dissociate", thrown into a blender, pitch shifted with some delays, and whizzed
for a solid 4 minutes. Serve fresh with some way too bass-y synths.
