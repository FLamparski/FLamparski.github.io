Inspired by the Depression Robot Show. End of Evangelion suuuuuuucks.

This song took me forever to complete because for the longest time I didn't have a chorus, so I
shelved it until I found one. There was a whole thing where the verses were going to be in C and
the chorus in F but the chorus I had wasn't much of a chorus. In the end I had a new idea, recycled
the old version of this in B and slapped some Japanese railroad crossing bells on the front.

## Lyrics

An angel with no wings\
I'm fighting from within\
What ends and what begins\
I can't pick a side\
See you in my dreams\
There is no in between\
Destroy all that I've been\
I can't get it right

And you can tell me how to feel\
But I have been here before

Paralysed\
I'm falling\
Legends\
They're calling\
Terrified\
I'm dreaming\
Rapture\
A new beginning\
Paralysed\
No longer\
Choices\
I'm stronger\
Finally\
I'm seeing\
Reasons\
To keep on being

No-one's what they seem\
A terror from within\
Afraid to let you in\
I can't pick a side\
See me in your dreams\
The walls in between\
Rebuild all that I've been\
I will get it right

And you can tell me how to feel\
And you can tell me it's not real\
But I can read between the lines\
'Cause I have been here before

Paralysed\
I'm falling\
Legends\
They're calling\
Terrified\
I'm dreaming\
Rapture\
A new beginning\
Paralysed\
No longer\
Choices\
I'm stronger\
Finally\
I'm seeing\
Reasons\
To keep on being

You are not alone\
You are in control\
You can make your wish come true\
You can do it all\
You are not alone\
You are in control\
You can make your wish come true\
You can do it all

Paralysed\
I'm falling\
Legends\
They're calling\
Terrified\
I'm dreaming\
Rapture\
A new beginning\
Paralysed\
No longer\
Choices\
I'm stronger\
Finally\
I'm seeing\
Reasons\
To keep on being
