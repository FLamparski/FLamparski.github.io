## Lyrics

You make me nervous, make me nervous\
You make me nervous, and not in a good way (make me nervous)\
You make me nervous, make me nervous\
You make me nervous, but I still want you babe (make me nervous)

Yo, when I met you I could tell I was gonna fall\
Dork in a backless dress, girl you had it all\
Maybe it was never quite meant to be\
But maybe it's for the better or maybe it's just me\
We were never free at the same time back at uni\
But we hung out a lot, chatted shit 'bout love and UNIX\
Red flags kept whizzing by like corrida\
I'm spending my life falling for difficult people

You make me nervous, make me nervous\
You make me nervous, and not in a good way (make me nervous)\
You make me nervous, make me nervous\
You make me nervous, but I still want you babe (make me nervous)

Cause it goes like this:\
Girl, I find normal people boring, I wanna know your story\
Tell me 'bout your issues, I got some too, don't worry\
I cannot keep ignoring that I clearly have a type\
Best way to my heart is bonding over crap in life\
And then we vibe, look each other in the eyes\
For one brief moment it all just seems alright\
Still I worry that you've only seen me at my best of times\
But maybe we can deal with each other's worst nights

If it's a few exes later, we could be an item\
If it's a few songs away, I am gonna write them\
Let's make our lives brighter\
The world might just feel nicer\
Or at least we can forget\
that it's all a bloody nightmare

You make me nervous, make me nervous\
You make me nervous, but it's all in a good way (make me nervous)\
You make me nervous, make me nervous\
You make me nervous, and I still want you babe (make me nervous)

## Trivia

Most of the sounds came from my Arturia Microfreak, while some were made with Behringer Crave.
It's all pretty processed anyway.
