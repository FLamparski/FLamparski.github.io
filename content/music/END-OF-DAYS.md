## Lyrics

Glug glug glug goes the corpse in the Thames\
Tensions spilling over, gotta tell all my friends\
Let's all worry 'bout things out of our control\
I promise that it just ain't good for the soul

(But the news says!)\
Our planet's ablaze\
(And the news says!)\
We cannot behave\
(But the news says!)\
Like tidal waves\
(And new news says!)\
It's the end of days

The world is always ending til you turn the radio off\
Yeah the times are bad and we should be doing better\
But sometimes, enough is enough!\
Second hand paranoia will never be your friend\
And the birds of doom will follow to the letter\
Your nightmares until the end

Step step step goes the gammon parade\
Gotta panic buy cake before the media blockade\
Let's all worry 'bout stuff we have no power over\
On this everyday thirty first of October

(But the news says!)\
Our planet's ablaze\
(And the news says!)\
We cannot behave\
(But the news says!)\
Like tidal waves\
(And new news says!)\
It's the end of days

The world is always ending til you turn the radio off\
Yeah the times are bad and we should be doing better\
But sometimes, enough is enough!\
Second hand paranoia will never be your friend\
And the birds of doom will follow to the letter\
Your nightmares until the end

The world is always ending since year eighteen-ninety five\
So enjoy your short stay here, what a time to be alive\
The world is always ending since year eighteen-ninety five\
So enjoy your short stay here, what a time to be alive

The world is always ending til you turn the radio off\
Yeah the times are bad and we should be doing better\
But sometimes, enough is enough!\
Second hand paranoia will never be your friend\
And the birds of doom will follow to the letter\
Your nightmares until the end

The world is always ending\
The world is always ending
